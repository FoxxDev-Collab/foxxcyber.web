# Blog Content Guide

This directory contains all blog posts for the FoxxCyber website. Each post should be written in MDX format (Markdown + JSX).

## Creating a New Blog Post

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in this directory
2. Use the following frontmatter structure at the top of your file:

```mdx
---
title: 'Your Post Title'
date: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
author: 'Author Name'
excerpt: 'A brief description of your post (150-160 characters recommended)'
tags: ['Tag1', 'Tag2', 'Tag3']
---
```

3. Write your content using Markdown syntax
4. You can use JSX components if needed

## Best Practices

- Use clear, descriptive titles
- Include a compelling excerpt
- Add relevant tags for better categorization
- Use proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
- Include images when appropriate
- Keep paragraphs short and scannable
- Use lists and tables for better readability
- Include internal links to related content
- Add a call-to-action at the end

## Image Guidelines

- Place images in the `public/images/blog` directory
- Use descriptive filenames
- Optimize images before adding them
- Include alt text for accessibility
